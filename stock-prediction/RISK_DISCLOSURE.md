# Risk Disclosure

This project and its code are for educational and research purposes only. Please read the following disclosures before using any models, strategies, or results.

## 1. Model Limitations
- This is **not financial advice**. No guarantee of profit or loss prevention is provided.
- **Past performance does not guarantee future results.** Markets can change rapidly and unpredictably.
- The models may not capture regime changes, black swan events, or sudden market shocks.

## 2. Known Biases
- **Survivorship bias:** Delisted stocks and failed companies are not included in the data.
- **Look-ahead bias risks:** All features are designed to be real-time computable, but users must ensure no future data is used in live trading.
- **Overfitting:** Models may fit the training period well but perform poorly out-of-sample.

## 3. Cost Assumptions
- **Transaction costs** are estimates and may differ from real-world trading.
- **Slippage** depends on market liquidity and order size; actual costs may be higher.
- The system does **not account for market impact** from large trades or illiquid assets.

## 4. Usage Guidelines
- **Paper trade first:** Test strategies in a simulated environment before risking real capital.
- **Position sizing and risk management** are essential. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.
- Use the models as a learning tool, not as a substitute for professional advice.

## 5. Compliance
- **You are responsible for regulatory compliance** in your jurisdiction.
- **Algorithmic trading may require licenses** or registration with financial authorities.
- **Data usage must comply with provider terms** (e.g., Yahoo Finance, exchanges).

**Summary:**
